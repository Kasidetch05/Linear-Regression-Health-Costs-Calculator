# Linear-Regression-Health-Costs-Calculator

---
Introduction

This project uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to predict individual healthcare expenses. This is a regression problem, meaning the model's goal is to output a continuous numerical value (the predicted cost) rather than a category (like "spam" or "ham").

---

The Goal

The primary objective of this model is to estimate annual individual medical expenses with high accuracy.
Success Criterion: The model must achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than $3,500. This means, on average, the model's prediction should be within $3,500 of the actual cost.

---

The Data Used
To predict the cost, the model analyzes several key features about an individual:

- Age

- Body Mass Index (BMI)

- Number of Children

- Sex

- Smoker Status (Yes/No - a very strong predictor!)

- Geographic Region

Data Preparation Steps
Before the neural network can use the data, we prepared it:

1. Categorical Conversion: Non-numerical details like sex (male/female) and smoker status (yes/no) were converted into simple numerical flags (0 or 1).

2. Region Encoding: The region feature was processed using One-Hot Encoding. This means we created a separate 0/1 column for each possible region (e.g., region_northwest, region_southeast).

3. Train/Test Split: The entire dataset was split into two parts: 80% for training the model and 20% for testing its performance on data it has never seen before.

The Prediction Engine (Model Architecture)
The prediction is handled by a simple, three-layer Sequential Neural Network.

1. Input Layer: This layer receives the prepared features (age, BMI, smoker status, etc.) for a single person.
2. Hidden Layers (Two): The model uses two deep layers, each with 64 units and the ReLU activation function. These layers work to identify complex, non-linear relationships between the input features (e.g., how the combination of being a smoker and having a high BMI affects costs).
3. Output Layer: This final layer has a single output unit with no activation function (a linear output). It simply outputs the predicted dollar amount for the healthcare expense.

Training: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its loss function, which guides the network to minimize the average prediction error.

Performance Snapshot
The model was rigorously tested on unseen data to check its real-world effectiveness.
- Test MAE Result: The final model's performance on the test set is calculated.
- MAE Interpretation: The MAE tells us the average difference between the predicted cost and the actual cost. For example, an MAE of $3,200 means, on average, the prediction is off by that amount.

The script includes visual plots that compare the predicted expenses against the actual expenses. A perfect model would show all data points lying exactly on a 45-degree diagonal line. Our final plot shows how close the predictions are to this ideal line.

Code Overview
The script is logically divided into cells that manage the entire machine learning pipeline:
- CELL 1-4: Handles all Data Loading and Preprocessing, including feature conversion and the train/test split.

- CELL 5: Builds the Neural Network architecture (Dense layers).

- CELL 6: Trains the model and plots the training history (Loss and MAE over epochs).

- CELL 7-10: Evaluates Model Performance on the test set, calculates the final MAE score, and visualizes the prediction errors.

- CELL 11-12: Includes an Alternative Model (a deeper network) and the Final Test Cell to ensure the best-performing model is selected for the final results.
